Saucy is a superb framework for developing data heavy applications, and it provides a large set of user friendly and customizable components to manage and visualize enterprise data. We will look at real-world examples of custom Saucy components that are built to provide a great user experience, but also with code maintenance and refactoring in mind.",

Developers don't always understand JavaScript/HTML/CSS, so they frequently end up solving problems by coding away in JavaScript when they could, and potentially should, be solved elsewhere. As an unfortunate side effect to this issue, unfamiliarity with the language causes developers to write a lot of code which can have mistakes and be difficult to read and understand. This talk is not about never writing JavaScript. It is about writing JavaScript when you actually need to and in a minimal fashion.",

According to Forrester, software development is reaching a zero day event as feedback driven development is taking over requirements driven development. Because of this change, organizations need tools to optimize on the frequency of software delivery. In this presentation, we’ll explore unique ways to improve speed of app development using Saucy’s tools for visual drag-and-drop based app building and theming.",

Learn about the new bridge we’ve created that enables you to use the Saucy components in your Pointy 2 based apps. We’ve integrated the frameworks, so Saucy components recognize the Pointy 2 directives and appropriately respond to events. If you’re a Pointy 2 user, there is no reason why you can’t use it to assemble the basic building blocks of an app and then add the powerful Saucy components to complete your data-centric, cross-platform applications.",
